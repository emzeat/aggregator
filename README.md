# Collection of scripts for gathering device data

This is a collection of very simple scripts used to monitor some
of the devices installed on our network. Do not expect this to just
work out of the box as some code might be heavily biased to my own
needs or only be tested with certain configurations.

Rather see this as a way to have examples for pulling data from
some IOT devices. Some scripts have been created by expanding on the
work of others, some are simply using existing pypi packages and yet
some more may be completely new works.
